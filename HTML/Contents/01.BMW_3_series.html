		Unmistakable design elements make the BMW 3 Series the sportiest member in its vehicle class. With a contemporary interpretation of the classic three-box design, the vehicle upholds the design tradition of the BMW brand: long bonnet, short overhangs, long wheelbase and set-back passenger compartment. In this way, the best-selling BMW Series of all time continues to lead the way within its segment.

		<span id="text2">
			The sporty-elegant exterior is harmoniously coordinated, conveying aesthetics and dynamics as soon as you set eyes on it. With their horizontal slats, the intricately designed air inlets in the front apron combine with the front lights to emphasise the wide stance on the road. As an option, the double round headlights with integrated corona rings are available in LED technology.
			But it’s not just the front that’s an eye-catcher. The strikingly shaped rear bumper has two horizontal lines and the rear lights with LED technology are set wide apart, ensuring that the BMW 3 Series Sedan retains its unmistakable appearance at night as well.
			The version with Sport Line in Mediterranean Blue metallic and with 19" light alloy wheels is just one of many possibilities to add a personal touch to the BMW 3 Series Sedan – each of which underscores the unique sporty character of the vehicle.

			In addition to the standard-feature rear lights in LED technology, the headlights and fog lights of the BMW 3 Series Sedan are also available with LED light units.

					All the light functions in the LED headlights with daytime running lights, parking lights and indicators are powered by LED technology. The high-beam and low-beam lights consist of 10 high-power LEDs. The headlights come with automatic headlight range control, deliver brilliant illumination of the road ahead and thereby improve safety at night and in bad weather.
					LEDs (light emitting diodes) are characterised by their long lifespan and consume up to 50 percent less energy than conventional light bulbs. So they also help to reduce fuel consumption and emissions output. What's more, the light they produce is very similar to daylight so it's particularly gentle on the eyes. The flat outer contour of the LED headlights also accentuates the car's athletic style.

			<div id="info" class="truns" style="width: 50%; height: 0px; transition: 0.3s">
				<span id="textus2" style=" opacity: 0; transition: 0.3s; font-size:0px; color: white;">
					Adaptive LED headlights are characterized by light distribution that automatically adjusts to the driving speed, dynamically illuminating the road ahead. In addition to indicators and daytime running lights, it includes the Adaptive headlight function with variable city and motorway light distribution, cornering lights, as well as BMW Selective Beam (anti-dazzle high-beam assistant), which automatically switches between the low and high-beam lights. That allows the system to offer optimal road illumination under all conditions.
					In the dark, the moveable headlights allow the driver to see far into curves as soon as the wheel is turned. To improve short-range visibility, the cornering lights are automatically activated as soon as the turn indicator is switched on or the steering wheel is turned – even when the vehicle is at a standstill. The Adaptive headlights ensure optimum illumination on the road, significantly increasing active safety.
					BMW Selective Beam allows the driver to leave the high-beams on whenever they are needed, facilitating optimal visual conditions at night. The system monitors the presence of vehicles in front or oncoming traffic and adjusts the high-beam lights to avoid dazzling other road users.

					LED fog lights increase short-range visibility in fog or precipitation, improving night-time driving safety. Along with their broad beam angle, they are notable for the colour of their light – which is extremely similar to daylight – their long lifespan and their low energy consumption.
					At the same time, the LED fog lights below the headlights set a technically advanced, modern tone for the already striking front of the BMW 3 Series.

				<span id="textus4"  style=" opacity: 0; transition: 0.3s; font-size:0px; color: white;">
					The Rear lights with lighting elements in LED technology consist of individual high-performance LED lighting elements and have the characteristic BMW "L" shape. That strengthens the rear end's identity as a BMW and makes the vehicle recognisable as a BMW even in the dark.
					The large indicators and fast-acting LED brake lights also play a role in making the BMW 3 Series even safer.

			As soon as you get into the BMW 3 Series Sedan, you immediately notice the driver orientation and outstanding material quality. The interior is spacious, with practical storage possibilities and a functional, uncluttered instrument panel. At the same time, it is dominated by elegance and dynamics. Numerous highlights in Chrome as well as surfaces in Black high-gloss underscore the outstanding quality. In typical BMW style, the cockpit is orientated systematically towards the driver, making it extremely easy to operate.
			Each and every ergonomic challenge was mastered with the greatest of care and attention. The best example is the 8.8" Control Display of the optional Navigation system Professional: free-standing above the centre console, it exudes a premium-quality look & feel. The centre console has a holder for two drinks and its roller cover, when closed, can be used as a storage surface. Just two of many details in an overall concept that perfectly combines sportiness with modernity.
