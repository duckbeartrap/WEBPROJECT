    The BMW 5 Series Sedan is tailor-made to meet the highest requirements. Intelligent networking and the latest technologies from BMW ConnectedDrive pave the way for previously unattainable latitude and flexibility. Perfect for everyone who expects more from a sedan than just a stylish appearance: the most advanced 5 Series Sedan ever.

      <h1 id="heading2">Design.</h1>
      <span id="text2">
      Built to meet the highest requirements: the BMW 5 Series, with its dynamic proportions and modern shape, is impressive at first glance. This look is consistently implemented from the front, over the striking silhouette, to the rear. The new optional LED headlights are slightly bevelled at the top and stand out in its charismatic face. A bold double kidney grille slants forward more prominently, indicating the power that lies dormant behind it, and allows the BMW 5 Sedan to take centre stage. The theme started by the front is carried through in the self-confident elegance of the side lines. In addition to the classic forms of a BMW Sedan with lengthened bonnet, short overhangs and a large wheel base, the BMW 5 Series Sedan also shows off its sportiness. And just as confidently presents its new rear lights. With their optical depth and L-shaped design, they integrate perfectly into the rear end with its newly-designed bumpers and round off the entire look in an aesthetically pleasurable way.

    <h1 id="heading4">INTERIOR DESIGN.</h1>
    <span id="text4">
      Perfectly tailored: the interior of the BMW 5 Series Sedan is like a made-to-measure suit. The harmonious look-and-feel, the high-quality materials – everything is just right. In typical BMW fashion, the logically-structured cockpit is driver-orientated and appears to surround him. All instruments are ergonomically arranged and the comfort functions are also within the passenger’s reach.
      The elegant interdependency of horizontal surfaces and taut lines mean that all passengers enjoy a generous sense of space, whether they’re seated in the front or the rear. The optical centre is always inclined towards the road and the self-confident, modern look of the interior clearly communicates a feeling of comfort and security. The optional BMW Lines Luxury and Modern give you the choice of two design worlds, both of which lend the refined and luxurious material and design of the BMW 5 Series Sedan a particularly independent character.

      <h1 id="heading5">ADAPTIVE LED HEADLIGHTS.</h1>
      <span id="text5">
      The Adaptive LED Headlight includes Adaptive Headlight with variable urban and motorway light distribution, cornering light and BMW Selective Beam (anti-dazzle High-Beam Assistant) with automatic high-beam headlight activation. The system thus provides optimum road illumination in all conditions.
      The moving headlamps allow you to see deep into corners in the dark as soon as you start turning the steering wheel. To improve short-range visibility, the cornering lights are automatically activated as soon as the turn indicator is switched on or the steering wheel is turned – even when the vehicle is at a standstill. The Adaptive Headlights ensure optimum illumination in every situation on the road, significantly increasing active safety.
      The BMW Selective Beam (anti-dazzle High-Beam Assistant) automatically controls the high-beam headlights, depending on the ambient light conditions and traffic situation, ensuring excellent visibility when driving at night. The system monitors the presence of vehicles driving ahead or oncoming traffic and continuously adjusts the high-beam headlights to avoid dazzling other road users.

          The special equipment ambient lighting provides gentle, stylish illumination. This underscores the luxurious ambience and also serves as a functional source of light, e.g. in the storage compartment of the centre console as well as in the door pockets and side lining. The colour switch function lets you create your preferred mood by giving you the choice between a bright white or muted orange light.

          The optional multifunctional instrument display stages the different driving experience modes with customised instrument displays – and thus creates worlds of colour and mood for more safety, efficiency and exemplary driver orientation. Navigation instructions and information from the driver assistance systems can now be registered even more easily at a glance. With these features, the new digital presentation distinctly increases the comfort, experience and safety of driving.

          The BMW 5 Series Sedan is equipped with the innovative Bang & Olufsen high-end surround sound system. Supreme listening pleasure and a magnificent driving sensation merge into one unique experience. Sixteen active speakers with a total of 1,200 watts produce music in brilliant quality. Acoustic options can be selected: in ‘Studio’ mode, a clear sound emerges, while in ‘Expanded’ mode, the acoustic space appears enlarged, thus creating an incomparable surround-sound experience.
